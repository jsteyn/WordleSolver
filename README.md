I think I am now officially hooked on playing different versions of wordle in Afrikaans and English. So I needed a program to help out because I do not like the online tools you get and also, as far as I know, they aren't available for Afrikaans. So I wrote this program in Java.

If Java is installed on your computer you should be able to just double click on the .jar file.
